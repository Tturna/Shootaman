Unity game I made to learn game feel, visual effects and 3D model animations.

## This is an old project and I probably won't be continuing it.

This project taught me game about game feel or "juice", 3D modeling, model animations and FPS style combat.

You can get a Windows build of the game from my Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aIBEPlca-1r77ymQ_wqj9Fr3qCfB5YYU/view?usp=share_link).
